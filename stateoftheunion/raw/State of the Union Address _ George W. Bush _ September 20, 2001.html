			<h2>George W. Bush</h2>
			<h3>September 20, 2001</h3>


			<p>
To the Congress of the United States:</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President pro tempore, Members of Congress, and fellow
Americans:</p>

<p>In the normal course of events, Presidents come to this chamber to report on the
state of the Union. Tonight, no such report is needed. It has already been
delivered by the American people.</p>

<p>We have seen it in the courage of passengers, who rushed terrorists to save
others on the groundpassengers like an exceptional man named Todd Beamer.
Please help me to welcome his wife, Lisa Beamer, here tonight.</p>

<p>We have seen the state of our Union in the endurance of rescuers, working past
exhaustion. We have seen the unfurling of flags, the lighting of candles, the
giving of blood, the saying of prayersin English, Hebrew, and Arabic.</p>

<p>We have seen the decency of a loving and giving people, who have made the grief
of strangers their own.</p>

<p>My fellow citizens, for the last nine days, the entire world has seen for itself
the state of our Unionand it is strong.</p>

<p>Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom. Our
grief has turned to anger, and anger to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies
to justice, or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done. I thank the
Congress for its leadership at such an important time. All of America was
touched on the evening of the tragedy to see Republicans and Democrats, joined
together on the steps of this Capitol, singing God Bless America. And you
did more than sing, you acted, by delivering forty billion dollars to rebuild
our communities and meet the needs of our military.</p>

<p>Speaker Hastert and Minority Leader Gephardt, Majority Leader Daschle, and
Senator Lott, I thank you for your friendship and your leadership and your
service to our country. And on behalf of the American people, I thank the world
for its outpouring of support. America will never forget the sounds of our
National Anthem playing at Buckingham Palace, and on the streets of Paris, and
at Berlins Brandenburg Gate. We will not forget South Korean children gathering
to pray outside our embassy in Seoul, or the prayers of sympathy offered at a
mosque in Cairo. We will not forget moments of silence and days of mourning in
Australia and Africa and Latin America.</p>

<p>Nor will we forget the citizens of eighty other nations who died with our own.
Dozens of Pakistanis. More than 130 Israelis. More than 250 citizens of India.
Men and women from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico, and Japan. And hundreds of British
citizens. America has no truer friend than Great Britain. Once again, we are
joined together in a great cause. The British Prime Minister has crossed an
ocean to show his unity of purpose with America, and tonight we welcome Tony
Blair.</p>

<p>On September the eleventh, enemies of freedom committed an act of war against
our country. Americans have known warsbut for the past 136 years, they have
been wars on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in 1941. Americans have known
the casualties of warbut not at the center of a great city on a peaceful
morning. Americans have known surprise attacksbut never before on thousands of
civilians. All of this was brought upon us in a single dayand night fell on a
different world, a world where freedom itself is under attack.</p>

<p>Americans have many questions tonight. Americans are asking: Who attacked our
country?</p>

<p>The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated
terrorist organizations known as al-Qaida. They are the same murderers indicted
for bombing American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and responsible for the
bombing of the U.S.S. Cole.</p>

<p>Al-Qaida is to terror what the mafia is to crime. But its goal is not making
money; its goal is remaking the worldand imposing its radical beliefs on people
everywhere.</p>

<p>The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been
rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clericsa fringe
movement that perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam. The terrorists
directive commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans, and
make no distinctions among military and civilians, including women and children.</p>

<p>This group and its leadersa person named Usama bin Ladinare linked to many
other organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad
and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.</p>

<p>There are thousands of these terrorists in more than sixty countries. They are
recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods, and brought to camps in
places like Afghanistan where they are trained in the tactics of terror. They
are sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to
plot evil and destruction.</p>

<p>The leadership of al-Qaida has great influence in Afghanistan, and supports the
Taliban regime in controlling most of that country. In Afghanistan, we see
al-Qaidas vision for the world. Afghanistans people have been brutalized many
are starving and many have fled. Women are not allowed to attend school. You can
be jailed for owning a television. Religion can be practiced only as their
leaders dictate. A man can be jailed in Afghanistan if his beard is not long
enough.</p>

<p>The United States respects the people of Afghanistanafter all, we are currently
its largest source of humanitarian aidbut we condemn the Taliban regime. It is
not only repressing its own people, it is threatening people everywhere by
sponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists. By aiding and abetting
murder, the Taliban regime is committing murder. And tonight, the United States
of America makes the following demands on the Taliban:</p>

<p>Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of al-Qaida who hide in
your land.</p>

<p>Release all foreign nationalsincluding American citizensyou have unjustly
imprisoned, and protect foreign journalists, diplomats, and aid workers in your
country.</p>

<p>Close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in Afghanistan
and hand over every terrorist, and every person in their support structure, to
appropriate authorities. Give the United States full access to terrorist
training camps, so we can make sure they are no longer operating. These demands
are not open to negotiation or discussion. The Taliban must act and act
immediately. They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their
fate.</p>

<p>I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world: We
respect your faith. It is practiced freely by many millions of Americans, and by
millions more in countries that America counts as friends. Its teachings are
good and peaceful, and those who commit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme the
name of Allah. The terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying, in
effect, to hijack Islam itself.</p>

<p>The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our many Arab
friends. Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists, and every government that
supports them.</p>

<p>Our war on terror with al-Qaida, but it does not end there. It will not end
until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and
defeated. Americans are asking: Why do they hate us?</p>

<p>They hate what we see right here in this chambera democratically elected
government. Their leaders are self-appointed. They hate our freedomsour freedom
of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and
disagree with each other. They want to overthrow existing governments in many
Muslim countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. They want to drive
Israel out of the Middle East. They want to drive Christians and Jews out of
vast regions of Asia and Africa.</p>

<p>These terrorists kill not merely to end lives, but to disrupt and end a way of
life. With every atrocity, they hope that America grows fearful, retreating from
the world and forsaking our friends. They stand against us, because we stand in
their way.</p>

<p>We are not deceived by their pretenses to piety. We have seen their kind before.
They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the twentieth century. By
sacrificing human life to serve their radical visionsby abandoning every value
except the will to powerthey follow in the path of fascism, and Nazism, and
totalitarianism. And they will follow that path all the way, to where it ends:
in historys unmarked grave of discarded lies.</p>

<p>Americans are asking: How will we fight and win this war?</p>

<p>We will direct every resource at our commandevery means of diplomacy, every
tool of intelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, every financial
influence, and every necessary weapon of warto the disruption and defeat of the
global terror network. This war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade
ago, with its decisive liberation of territory and its swift conclusion. It will
not look like the air war above Kosovo two years ago, where no ground troops
were used and not a single American was lost in combat.</p>

<p>Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes.
Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other
we have seen. It may include dramatic strikes, visible on television, and covert
operations, secret even in success. We will starve terrorists of funding, turn
them one against another, drive them from place to place, until there is no
refuge or rest. And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to
terrorism.</p>

<p>Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with
us, or you are with the terrorists. From this day forward, any nation that
continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States
as a hostile regime.</p>

<p>Our Nation has been put on notice: We are not immune from attack. We will take
defensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans. Today, dozens of
Federal departments and agencies, as well as State and local governments, have
responsibilities affecting homeland security.</p>

<p>These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level. So tonight I announce
the creation of a Cabinet-level position reporting directly to methe Office of
Homeland Security. And tonight I also announce a distinguished American to lead
this effort to strengthen Americas securitya military veteran, an effective
Governor, a true patriot, and my trusted friend, Pennsylvanias Governor Tom
Ridge. He will lead, oversee, and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy
to safeguard our country against terrorism, and respond to any attacks that may
come.</p>

<p>These measures are essential. But the only way to defeat terrorism as a threat
to our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where it grows.</p>

<p>Many will be involved in this effort, from FBI agents to intelligence operatives
to the reservists we have called to active duty. All deserve our thanks, and all
have our prayers. And tonight, a few miles from the damaged Pentagon, I have a
message for our military: Be ready. I have called the armed forces to alert, and
there is a reason. The hour is coming when America will act, and you will make
us proud.</p>

<p>This is not, however, just Americas fight. And what is at stake is not just
Americas freedom. This is the worlds fight. This is civilizations fight. This
is the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance and
freedom.</p>

<p>We ask every nation to join us. We will ask, and we will need, the help of
police forces, intelligence services, and banking systems around the world. The
United States is grateful that many nations and many international organizations
have already respondedwith sympathy and with support. Nations from Latin
America, to Asia, to Africa, to Europe, to the Islamic world. Perhaps the NATO
Charter reflects best the attitude of the world: an attack on one is an attack
on all.</p>

<p>The civilized world is rallying to Americas side. They understand that if this
terror goes unpunished, their own cities, their own citizens may be next.
Terror, unanswered, can not only bring down buildings, it can threaten the
stability of legitimate governments. And we will not allow it.</p>

<p>Americans are asking: What is expected of us?</p>

<p>I ask you to live your lives and hug your children. I know many citizens have
fears tonight, and I ask you to be calm and resolute, even in the face of a
continuing threat.</p>

<p>I ask you to uphold the values of America, and remember why so many have come
here. We are in a fight for our principles, and our first responsibility is to
live by them. No one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words
because of their ethnic background or religious faith.</p>

<p>I ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with your
contributions. Those who want to give can go to a central source of information,
libertyunites.org, to find the names of groups providing direct help in New
York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. The thousands of FBI agents who are now at
work in this investigation may need your cooperation, and I ask you to give it.</p>

<p>I ask for your patience, with the delays and inconveniences that may accompany
tighter securityand for your patience in what will be a long struggle.</p>

<p>I ask your continued participation and confidence in the American economy.
Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch its
source. America is successful because of the hard work, and creativity, and
enterprise of our people.</p>

<p>These were the true strengths of our economy before September eleventh, and they
are our strengths today. Finally, please continue praying for the victims of
terror and their families, for those in uniform, and for our great country.
Prayer has comforted us in sorrow, and will help strengthen us for the journey
ahead.</p>

<p>Tonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done and for what
you will do. And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, I thank you, their
representatives, for what you have already done, and for what we will do
together.</p>

<p>Tonight, we face new and sudden national challenges. We will come together to
improve air safety, to dramatically expand the number of air marshals on
domestic flights, and take new measures to prevent hijacking. We will come
together to promote stability and keep our airlines flying with direct
assistance during this emergency. We will come together to give law enforcement
the additional tools it needs to track down terror here at home. We will come
together to strengthen our intelligence capabilities to know the plans of
terrorists before they act, and find them before they strike. We will come
together to take active steps that strengthen Americas economy, and put our
people back to work.</p>

<p>Tonight we welcome here two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of all
New Yorkers: Governor George Pataki and Mayor Rudy Giuliani. As a symbol of
Americas resolve, my Administration will work with the Congress, and these two
leaders, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City.</p>

<p>After all that has just passedall the lives taken, and all the possibilities
and hopes that died with themit is natural to wonder if Americas future is one
of fear. Some speak of an age of terror. I know there are struggles ahead, and
dangers to face. But this country will define our times, not be defined by them.
As long as the United States of America is determined and strong, this will not
be an age of terror; this will be an age of liberty, here and across the world.</p>

<p>Great harm has been done to us. We have suffered great loss. And in our grief
and anger we have found our mission and our moment. Freedom and fear are at war.
The advance of human freedomthe great achievement of our time, and the great
hope of every timenow depends on us. Our Nation this generationwill lift a
dark threat of violence from our people and our future. We will rally the world
to this cause, by our efforts and by our courage. We will not tire, we will not
falter, and we will not fail.</p>

<p>It is my hope that in the months and years ahead, life will return almost to
normal. Well go back to our lives and routines, and that is good. Even grief
recedes with time and grace. But our resolve must not pass. Each of us will
remember what happened that day, and to whom it happened. We will remember the
moment the news camewhere we were and what we were doing. Some will remember an
image of fire, or a story of rescue. Some will carry memories of a face and a
voice gone forever. And I will carry this. It is the police shield of a man
named George Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others.
It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. This is
my reminder of lives that ended, and a task that does not end.</p>

<p>I will not forget this wound to our country, or those who inflicted it. I will
not yieldI will not restI will not relent in waging this struggle for the
freedom and security of the American people.</p>

<p>The course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain. Freedom
and fear, justice and cruelty, have always been at war, and we know that God is
not neutral between them.</p>

<p>Fellow citizens, we will meet violence with patient justiceassured of the
rightness of our cause, and confident of the victories to come. In all that lies
before us, may God grant us wisdom, and may He watch over the United States of
America.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>GEORGE W. BUSH.
